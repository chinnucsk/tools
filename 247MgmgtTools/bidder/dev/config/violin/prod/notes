# Quick notes on violin layout format
#
# 1. range
#    Format: range lower_bound="0x3300000" upper_bound="0x4400000"
#    These numbers are expresed in sectors (512 bytes)
#    In this example 0x4400000 equals 71303168 (decimal) => 36507222016 bytes => 34 GB
#
# 2. log2_of_buckets_per_shard
#    Format:  log2_of_buckets_per_shard="21"
#    2 power log2_of_buckets_per_shard is the number of buckets per shard. The size of each bucket is fixed at 4096 bytes
#    In this example 2^21 equals 2097152. That gives the size of the shard in bytes as
#    2097152 * 4096 = 8 GB
#
# 3. shard_range
#    Format: shard_range lower_bound="0x80000000000" upper_bound="0x100000000000"
#    upper_bound of the last shard is calculated as 2 ^ (64 - log2_of_buckets_per_shard)
